## **PROECT SUMMARY**

### **DESCRIPTION**

We have designed an interactive web visualization project to showcase aspects of Commercial Real Estate in Canada. Our primary target audience are real estate investors who understand the nuanced variables and ideas presented in this project. 


### VISUALIZATIONS

1. **MACROECONOMICS IN CANADA (Jessica Giochoco):**
   - Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
   - Consumer Spending
   - Mortgage Rate
   - Unemployment Rates

2. **SECTOR & MARKET INFO (Elizabeth Koch):**
   - Market & Sector Infographic
   - Canadian Population Growth

3. **INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE (Naina Garg):**
   - Capital Value for Sectors and Markets
   - Income return, Capital growth, and Total return for Sectors and Markets
   
4. **INDUSTRIAL SECTOR (Elizabeth Koch):**
   - Vacancy & Rent Growth Rates in 6 Markets
   - National Absorption, New Supply (LHS), and Availability Rate 

### **RECOMMENDATION**

We recommend investing in the industrial real estate sector in Canada. Through a comprehensive set of innovative and intuitive web visualizations, we highlight the major macroeconomic movements in Canada, how commercial real estate  in Canada (across the four sectors and six markets) has performed during those economic troughs and peaks, and how one sector (INDUSTRIAL) has remained resilient producing high returns and net growth for investors.
